# Trait drain
Drain a trait from a prisoner, making you stronger

### Interaction with prisoner that has multiple positive traits
Only the available ones are shown. 

- If you don't have the trait, you will gain it. 
- If you have a lower ranking one (eg. quick), you will gain 1 level higher (intelligent)
- TODO: Make this be a chance, and the better the trait, the higher the chance. Currently it just happens 100% of the time
